If you have a look at our [Example Site](https://example.docsy.dev/about/), you'll see that we've organized 
the Documentation section into a number of subsections, each with some recommendations about what you might put 
in that section.

## Do I need to use this structure?

Absolutely not! The site structure in the Example Site was created to meet the needs of large docsets for large
products with lots of features, potential tasks, and reference elements. For a simpler docset (like this one!),
it's fine to just structure your docs around specific features that your users need to know about.  Even for larger
documentation sets, you may find that the structure isn't useful "as is", or that you don't need to use all the 
section types.
