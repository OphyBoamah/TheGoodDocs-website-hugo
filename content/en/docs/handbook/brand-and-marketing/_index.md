## Doctopus
The Doctopus is our logo and mascot. The tentacles represent the many arms that a tech writer sometimes needs to have in this multi-disciplinary art form. 

The Doctopus is designed to be able to hold different items such as tools or other logos, so that we can be contextually relevant at different times.
## Outreach
We welcome PSC member and community members talking about the project at meetups, conferences, events and on podcasts and other channels.
### Slide decks

## Style guide

The project style guide stipulates how to represent (and abbreviate) the project name in written form. This applies when you are writing or speaking about the project in public to others.
